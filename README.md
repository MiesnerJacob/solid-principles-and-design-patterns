# solid-principles-and-design-patterns

Welcome to my Python Design Patterns repository! This collection of Python files and exercises reflects my journey through the "Python: SOLID Principles and Top Design Patterns" course, focusing on essential Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns. Here, I've implemented various patterns and explored core principles to enhance my software development skills.

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find practical implementations and exercises covering key GoF design patterns and S.O.L.I.D principles. Each section corresponds to a specific pattern or principle, providing hands-on examples and solutions that deepen my understanding of effective software architecture.

## Key Topics Covered
* Design Patterns: Singleton, Factory Method, Builder, Adapter, Strategy, Observer, State.
* S.O.L.I.D Principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.
* Additional Concepts: Object-oriented Python, UML diagrams, architectural considerations.

## Usage
Explore each directory to delve into individual design patterns, principles, and object-oriented programming concepts:

* oop-refresh: Includes Python scripts for working with classes, aggregation, abstract classes, encapsulation, and interface contracts.
* design-patterns: Contains directories for behavioral, creational, and structural design patterns.
* solid: Contains examples illustrating both poor and effective implementations of S.O.L.I.D principles.
